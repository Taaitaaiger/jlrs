//! Enforce layout requirements of union fields.
//!
//! If a field of a Julia type is a union of several bits types, this field is stored in an
//! interesting way: the field will have the same alignment as the type in the union with the
//! largest alignment, and the same size as the type with the largest size, after the data a
//! single-byte flag is stored which indicates what the active variant is. Unlike normal struct
//! fields, the size doesn't  have to be a multiple of the alignment. This is unlike structs in
//! Rust, whose size is a multiple of their alignment.
//!
//! In order represent such a union in Rust, JlrsReflect.jl generates three separate fields: a
//! zero-sized alignment field which enforces the alignment, a container to store the raw bytes,
//! and a flag to indicate the active variant.
//!
//! This module provides three traits, one for each of the fields. [`Align`] ensures the next
//! field, which contains the data of the bits-union, is aligned correctly. [`BitsUnionContainer`]
//! and [`Flag`] are marker traits that are used by jlrs-derive to implement `ValidLayout`
//! correctly.

/// When a `Union` is used as a field type in a struct, there are two possible representations.
/// Which representation is chosen depends on its arguments.
///
/// In the general case the `Union` is simply represented as a `Value`. If all of the are isbits*
/// types an inline representation is used. In this case, the value is essentially stored in an
/// array of bytes that is large enough to contain the largest-sized value, followed by a single,
/// byte-sized flag. This array has the same alignment as the value with the largest required
/// alignment.
///
/// In order to take all of this into account, when mapping a Julia struct that has one of these
/// optimized unions as a field, they are translated to three distinct fields. The first is a
/// zero-sized type with a set alignment, the second a `BitsUnion`, and finally a `u8`. The
/// generic parameter of `BitsUnion` must always be `[MaybeUninit<u8>; N]` with N explicitly equal
/// to the size of the largest possible value. The previous, zero-sized, field ensures the
/// `BitsUnion` is properly aligned, the flag indicates the type of the stored value.
///
/// Currently, even though a struct that contains an optimized union is supported by the
/// `JuliaStruct` macro, these fields can't be used from Rust. If you want to access the value,
/// you can use `Value::get_field` which will essentially convert it to the general representation.
///
/// *The types that are eligible for the optimization is actually not limited to just isbits
/// types. In particular, a struct which contains an optimized union as a field is no longer an
/// isbits type but the optimization still applies.
