/// When a `Union` is used as a field type in a struct, there are two possible representations.
/// Which representation is chosen depends on its arguments.
///
/// In the general case the `Union` is simply represented as a `Value`. If all of the are isbits*
/// types an inline representation is used. In this case, the value is essentially stored in an
/// array of bytes that is large enough to contain the largest-sized value, followed by a single,
/// byte-sized flag. This array has the same alignment as the value with the largest required
/// alignment.
///
/// In order to take all of this into account, when mapping a Julia struct that has one of these
/// optimized unions as a field, they are translated to three distinct fields. The first is a
/// zero-sized type with a set alignment, the second a `BitsUnion`, and finally a `u8`. The
/// generic parameter of `BitsUnion` must always be `[MaybeUninit<u8>; N]` with N explicitly equal
/// to the size of the largest possible value. The previous, zero-sized, field ensures the
/// `BitsUnion` is properly aligned, the flag indicates the type of the stored value.
///
/// Currently, even though a struct that contains an optimized union is supported by the
/// `JuliaStruct` macro, these fields can't be used from Rust. If you want to access the value,
/// you can use `Value::get_field` which will essentially convert it to the general representation.
///
/// *The types that are eligible for the optimization is actually not limited to just isbits
/// types. In particular, a struct which contains an optimized union as a field is no longer an
/// isbits type but the optimization still applies.
