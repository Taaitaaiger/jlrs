//! Channel traits used to communicate with the async runtime.
//!
//! In order to communicate with a persistent task you must use channels that implement the traits
//! defined in this module. Persistent tasks need a backing channel whose sending half implements
//! [`ChannelSender`], whose receiving half implements [`ChannelReceiver`], and the pair must
//! implement [`Channel`]. All tasks need an implementation of [`OneshotSender`] to send their
//! result.
//!
//! Several implementations of these traits are provided by jlrs if the `async-std-rt` or `tokio-rt`
//! feature is enabled.
//!
//! [`PersistentTask`]: crate::async_util::task::PersistentTask
