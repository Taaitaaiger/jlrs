//! The main goal behind jlrs is to provide a simple and safe interface to the Julia C API that
//! lets you call code written in Julia from Rust and vice versa. Currently this crate is only
//! tested on Linux and Windows in combination with Julia 1.5 and is not compatible with earlier
//! versions of Julia.
//!
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! An incomplete list of features that are currently supported by jlrs:
//!
//!  - Access arbitrary Julia modules and their contents.
//!  - Call arbitrary Julia functions.
//!  - Include and use your own Julia code.
//!  - Load a custom system image.
//!  - Create values that Julia can use, and convert them back to Rust, from Rust.
//!  - Access the type information and fields of values and check their properties.
//!  - Create and use n-dimensional arrays.
//!  - Support for mapping Julia structs to Rust structs, which can be generated with `JlrsReflect.jl`.
//!  - Structs that can be mapped to Rust include those with type parameters and bits unions.
//!  - Use these features when calling Rust from Julia through `ccall`.
//!  - Offload long-running functions to another thread and `.await` the result with the (experimental) async runtime.
//!
//!
//! # Generating the bindings
//!
//! This crate depends on `jl-sys` which contains the raw bindings to the Julia C API, these are
//! generated by `bindgen`. You can find the requirements for using `bindgen` in [their User Guide].
//!
//! #### Linux
//!
//! The recommended way to install Julia is to download the binaries from the official website,
//! which is distributed in an archive containing a directory called `julia-x.y.z`. This directory
//! contains several other directories, including a `bin` directory containing the `julia`
//! executable.
//!
//! In order to ensure the `julia.h` header file can be found, either `/usr/include/julia/julia.h`
//! must exist, or you have to set the `JULIA_DIR` environment variable to `/path/to/julia-x.y.z`.
//! This environment variable can be used to override the default. Similarly, in order to load
//! `libjulia.so` you must add `/path/to/julia-x.y.z/lib` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
//! variable.
//!
//! #### Windows
//!
//! The recommended way to install Julia is to download the installer from the official website,
//! which will install Julia in a folder called `Julia-x.y.z`. This folder contains several other
//! folders, including a `bin` folder containing the `julia.exe` executable. You must set the
//! `JULIA_DIR` environment variable to the `Julia-x.y.z` folder and add `Julia-x.y.z\bin` to the
//! `PATH` environment variable. For example, if Julia is installed at `D:\Julia-x.y.z`,
//! `JULIA_DIR` must be set to `D:\Julia-x.y.z` and `D:\Julia-x.y.z\bin` must be added to `PATH`.
//!
//! Additionally, MinGW must be installed through Cygwin. To install this and all potentially
//! required dependencies, follow steps 1-4 of
//! [the instructions for compiling Julia on Windows using Cygwin and MinGW].
//! You must set the `CYGWIN_DIR` environment variable to the installation folder of Cygwin; this
//! folder contains some icons, `Cygwin.bat` and folders with names like `usr` and `bin`. For
//! example, if Cygwin is installed at `D:\cygwin64`, `CYGWIN_DIR` must be set to `D:\cygwin64`.
//!
//! Julia is compatible with the GNU toolchain on Windows. If you use rustup, you can set the
//! toolchain for a project that depends on `jl-sys` by calling the command
//! `rustup override set stable-gnu` in the project root folder.
//!
//!
//! # Using this crate
//!
//! The first thing you should do is `use` the [`prelude`]-module with an asterisk, this will
//! bring all the structs and traits you're likely to need into scope. If you're calling Julia
//! from Rust, you must initialize Julia before you can use it. You can do this by calling
//! [`Julia::init`]. Note that this method can only be called once, if you drop [`Julia`] you won't
//! be able to create a new one and have to restart the entire program. If you want to use a
//! custom system image, you must call [`Julia::init_with_image`] instead of [`Julia::init`].
//! If you're calling Rust from Julia everything has already been initialized, you can use `CCall`
//! instead.
//!
//! ## Calling Julia from Rust
//!
//! You can call [`Julia::include`] to include your own Julia code and either [`Julia::frame`] or
//! [`Julia::dynamic_frame`] to interact with Julia. If you want to have improved support for
//! backtraces `jlrs.jl` must be included. You can find this file [here]. This is necessary
//! because this functionality depends on some Julia code defined in that file.
//!
//! The other two methods, [`Julia::frame`] and [`Julia::dynamic_frame`], take a closure that
//! provides you with a [`Global`], and either a [`StaticFrame`] or [`DynamicFrame`] respectively.
//! [`Global`] is a token that lets you access Julia modules their contents, and other global
//! values, while the frames are used to deal with local Julia data.
//!
//! Local data must be handled properly: Julia is a programming language with a garbage collector
//! that is unaware of any references to data outside of Julia. In order to make it aware of this
//! usage a stack must be maintained. You choose this stack's size when calling [`Julia::init`].
//! The elements of this stack are called stack frames; they contain a pointer to the previous
//! frame, the number of protected values, and that number of pointers to values. The two frame
//! types offered by jlrs take care of all the technical details, a [`DynamicFrame`] will grow
//! to the required size while a [`StaticFrame`] has a definite number of slots. These frames can
//! be nested (ie stacked) arbitrarily.
//!
//! In order to call a Julia function, you'll need two things: a function to call, and arguments
//! to call it with. You can acquire the function through the module that defines it with
//! [`Module::function`]; [`Module::base`] and [`Module::core`] provide access to Julia's `Base`
//! and `Core` module respectively, while everything you include through [`Julia::include`] is
//! made available relative to the `Main` module which you can access by calling [`Module::main`].
//!
//! Julia data is represented by a [`Value`]. Basic data types like numbers, booleans, and strings
//! can be created through [`Value::new`] and several methods exist to create an n-dimensional
//! array. Each value will be protected by a frame, and the two share a lifetime in order to
//! enforce that a value can only be used as long as its protecting frame hasn't been dropped.
//! Julia functions, their arguments and their results are all `Value`s too. All `Value`s can be
//! called as functions, whether this will succeed depends on the value actually being a function.
//! You can copy data from Julia to Rust by calling [`Value::cast`].
//!
//! As a simple example, let's create two values and add them:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use jlrs::prelude::*;
//! # fn main() {
//! let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init(16).unwrap() };
//! julia.dynamic_frame(|global, frame| {
//!     // Create the two arguments
//!     let i = Value::new(frame, 2u64)?;
//!     let j = Value::new(frame, 1u32)?;
//!
//!     // We can find the addition-function in the base module
//!     let func = Module::base(global).function("+")?;
//!
//!     // Call the function and unbox the result
//!     let output = func.call2(frame, i, j)?.unwrap();
//!     output.cast::<u64>()
//! }).unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! You can also do this with a static frame:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use jlrs::prelude::*;
//! # fn main() {
//! let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init(16).unwrap() };
//! // Three slots; two for the inputs and one for the output.
//! julia.frame(3, |global, frame| {
//!     // Create the two arguments, each value requires one slot
//!     let i = Value::new(frame, 2u64)?;
//!     let j = Value::new(frame, 1u32)?;
//!
//!     // We can find the addition-function in the base module
//!     let func = Module::base(global).function("+")?;
//!
//!     // Call the function and unbox the result.  
//!     let output = func.call2(frame, i, j)?.unwrap();
//!     output.cast::<u64>()
//! }).unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This is only a small example, other things can be done with [`Value`] as well: their fields
//! can be accessed if the [`Value`] is some tuple or struct. They can contain more complex data;
//! if a function returns an array or a module it will still be returned as a [`Value`]. There
//! complex types are compatible with [`Value::cast`]. Additionally, you can create [`Output`]s in
//! a frame in order to protect a value from with a specific frame; this value will share that
//! frame's lifetime.
//!
//! ## Calling Rust from Julia
//!
//! Julia's `ccall` interface can be used to call `extern "C"` functions defined in Rust. There
//! are two major ways to use `ccall`, with a pointer to the function or a
//! `(:function, "library")` pair.
//!
//! A function can be cast to a void pointer and converted to a [`Value`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use jlrs::prelude::*;
//!
//! unsafe extern "C" fn call_me(arg: bool) -> isize {
//!     if arg {
//!         1
//!     } else {
//!         -1
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init(16).unwrap() };
//! julia.frame(2, |global, frame| {
//!     // Cast the function to a void pointer
//!     let call_me_val = Value::new(frame, call_me as *mut std::ffi::c_void)?;
//!
//!     // `myfunc` will call the function pointer, it's defined in the next block of code
//!     let func = Module::main(global).function("myfunc")?;
//!
//!     // Call the function and unbox the result.  
//!     let output = func.call1(frame, call_me_val)?
//!         .unwrap()
//!         .cast::<isize>()?;
//!
//!     assert_eq!(output, 1);
//!     
//!     Ok(())
//! }).unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! This pointer can be called from Julia:
//!
//! ```julia
//! function myfunc(callme::Ptr{Cvoid})::Int
//!     ccall(callme, Int, (Bool,), true)
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! You can also use functions defined in `dylib` and `cdylib` libraries. In order to create such
//! a library you need to add
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["dylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! or  
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["cdylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! respectively to your crate's `Cargo.toml`. Use a `dylib` if you want to use the crate in other
//! Rust crates, but if it's only intended to be called through `ccall` a `cdylib` is the better
//! choice. On Linux, compiling such a crate will be compiled to `lib<crate_name>.so`, on Windows
//! `lib<crate_name>.dll`.
//!
//! The functions you want to use with `ccall` must be both `extern "C"` functions to ensure the C
//! ABI is used, and annotated with `#[no_mangle]` to prevent name mangling. Julia can find
//! libraries in directories that are either on the default library search path or included by
//! setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux, or `PATH` on Windows. If the
//! compiled library is not directly visible to Julia, you can open it with `Libdl.dlopen` and
//! acquire function pointers with `Libdl.dlsym`. These pointers can be called the same way as
//! the pointer in the previous example.
//!
//! If the library is visible to Julia you can access it with the library name. If `call_me` is
//! defined in a crate called `foo`, the following should work:
//!
//! ```julia
//! ccall((:call_me, "libfoo"), Int, (Bool,), false)
//! ```
//!
//! One important aspect of calling Rust from other languages in general is that panicking across
//! an FFI boundary is undefined behaviour. If you're not sure your code will never panic, wrap it
//! with `std::panic::catch_unwind`.
//!
//! Many features provided by jlrs including accessing modules, calling functions, and borrowing
//! array data require a [`Global`] or a frame. You can access these by creating a [`CCall`]
//! first.
//!
//!
//! ## Async runtime
//!
//! The experimental async runtime runs Julia in a separate thread and allows multiple tasks to
//! run in parallel by offloading functions to a new thread in Julia and waiting for them to
//! complete without blocking the runtime. To use this feature you must to enable the `async`
//! feature flag:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! jlrs = { version = "0.7", features = ["async"] }
//! ```
//!
//! This features is only supported on Linux.
//!
//! The struct [`AsyncJulia`] is exported by the prelude and lets you initialize the runtime in
//! two ways, either as a task or as a thread. The first type should be used if you want to
//! integrate the async runtime into a larger project that uses `async_std`. In order for the
//! runtime to work correctly the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable must be set to a value
//! larger than 1.
//!
//! In order to call Julia with the async runtime you must implement the [`JuliaTask`] trait. The
//! `run`-method of this trait is similar to the closures that are used in the examples
//! above for the sync runtime; it provides you with a [`Global`] and an [`AsyncFrame`] which
//! implements the [`Frame`] trait. The [`AsyncFrame`] is required to use [`Value::call_async`]
//! which calls a function on a new thread using `Base.Threads.@spawn` and returns a `Future`.
//! While you await the result the runtime can handle another task. If you don't use
//! [`Value::call_async`] tasks are handled sequentially.
//!
//! It's important to keep in mind that allocating memory in Julia uses a lock, so if you run
//! multiple functions at the same time that allocate new values frequently the performance will
//! drop significantly. The garbage collector can only run when all threads have reached a
//! safepoint, which is the case whenever a function needs to allocate memory. If your function
//! takes a long time to complete but needs to allocate rarely, you should periodically call
//! `GC.safepoint` in Julia to ensure the garbage collector can run.
//!
//! You can find fully commented basic examples in [the examples directory of the repo].
//!
//!
//! # Custom types
//!
//! In order to map a struct in Rust to one in Julia you can derive [`JuliaStruct`]. This will
//! implement [`Cast`], [`JuliaType`], [`ValidLayout`], and [`JuliaTypecheck`] for that type. If
//! the struct in Julia has no type parameters and is a bits type you can also derive
//! [`IntoJulia`], which lets you use the type in combination with [`Value::new`].
//!
//! You should not implement these structs manually. The `JlrsReflect.jl` package can generate
//! generate the correct Rust struct for types that don't include any unions or tuples with type
//! parameters. The reason for this restriction is that the layout of tuple and union fields can
//! be very different depending on these parameters in a way that can't be nicely expressed in
//! Rust.
//!
//! These custom types can also be used when you call Rust from Julia through `ccall`.
//!
//!
//! # Lifetimes
//!
//! While reading the documentation for this crate, you will see that a lot of lifetimes are used.
//! Most of these lifetimes have a specific meaning:
//!
//! - `'base` is the lifetime of a frame created through [`Julia::frame`] or
//! [`Julia::dynamic_frame`]. This lifetime prevents you from using global Julia data outside of a
//! frame.
//!
//! - `'frame` is the lifetime of an arbitrary frame; in the base frame it will be the same as
//! `'base`. This lifetime prevents you from using Julia data after the frame that protects it
//! from garbage collection goes out of scope.
//!
//! - `'data` or `'borrow` is the lifetime of data that is borrowed. This lifetime prevents you
//! from mutably aliasing data and trying to use it after the borrowed data is dropped.
//!
//! - `'output` is the lifetime of the frame that created the output. This lifetime ensures that
//! when Julia data is protected by an older frame this data can be used until that frame goes out
//! of scope.
