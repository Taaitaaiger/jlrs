# jl-sys

This crate contains the raw bindings to the Julia C API generated by `bindgen`. You can find the requirements for using `bindgen` in [their User Guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html). New bindings can be generated by executing `generate_bindings.sh`, which is only necessary when a new version of Julia is released or when additional data or functions are added to the allowlist in `build.rs`.
